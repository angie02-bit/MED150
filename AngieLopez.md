</p>Creative statement<p>
    <p>As I get older I hope my journey to filmmaking continues to grow and i’m able to share all the stories I've hear and/or experienced. What originally began with an obsession with photography, editing my favorite shows while self teaching myself Adobe After Effects. Has now developed a love for storytelling and the process of creating the art that’s known as “Film”. Knowing each project is a personal one and viewers will either witness different perspectives in life or they will relate and feel like for once someone out there can relate to their same emotions, thoughts, anxieties.

A story I remember my grandma telling me about her life as a kid in a developing country, I asked her if she ever had a paranormal experience there. The story she described to me has stuck with me for years now, and I am itching to make it into a film. Whether it's a 3 minute short film or an hour and a half featured film. All I know is a story that original must be made into a visual for others to witness. Although, it’s not just about the story, what inspires my creativity most is the culture my stories come from. Peruvian culture is extremely beautiful, I describe it as almost mind and soul healing. Peru is making its way up in the main media, and I would like to help give the country an extra push in the spotlight, so others can experience the love and healing of the Peruvian experience.<p>
