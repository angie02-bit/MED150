    I chose this image because it captures this dystopian, empty feeling. I loved the fact that although the picture is darker, you can still see the detail in the shadows of the stairs and floor. The lighting for me, being slightly off-center but in the middle of the three staircases, signified to me that there will always be a sense of light or hope in every dark path. Even the ones that seem scary and dark and an unusual place to find light.
